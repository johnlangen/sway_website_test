          Summer was amazing—beach days, outdoor adventures, and endless
          sunshine. But now that fall is here, your skin might be telling a
          different story. After months of sun exposure, chlorine, sweat, and
          even saltwater, it’s time to focus on giving your skin the recovery it
          truly deserves.

          on your skin. According to the{" "}

          , sun damage builds up over time, contributing to dryness, uneven
          texture, discoloration, and even premature aging. Chlorine and sweat
          can strip essential oils, leaving your skin dull and dehydrated. The
          good news? With the right care and treatments, you can restore your
          skin’s natural glow.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Why Your Skin Needs Recovery</h2>
        <p>
          Prolonged sun exposure breaks down collagen and elastin, while heat
          and humidity weaken your barrier. Even diligent sunscreen users
          accumulate microscopic damage. Common signs include dullness,
          dehydration, clogged pores, pigmentation, and fine lines.
        </p>

          is customized to post-summer concerns for maximum results.
